      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        In this report we will discuss our approach to showcasing various worldwide statistics regarding the Covid virus. Each visualization type will be presented in detail.
      </p>

    <section id="introduction" role="doc-introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        We were tasked with creating 5 different explanatory visualizations of data about COVID-19 during a 24 hour hackathon as part of our HCI course. 
        We wanted to showcase the data that we believe is important and of interest, hence why we picked different data for different charts, in order to help keep track of statistics.
        Because of the short time, we had to choose a more simple approach, so we decided to use Python as our programming language, and the framework Streamlit 
        in order to bring our ideas to life.The app crawls the given <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">website</a>, and uses the statistics 
          found there in order to create the aforementioned visualizations. Each visualization is completely interactive, and can be viewed in full screen, 
          zoomed and dragged around. By pressing the button "Get updated data", the website is crawled again, and the data is updated.
      </p>

    <section id="deliverables">
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        By pressing the button "Get updated data", the website is crawled again, and the data is updated. We decided to split the options to visualize data 
        into two different categories: all countries together, and individual countries. This gives the user the option to compare countries, as well as 
        see more in depth statistics about the country of choice.
      </p>
      <section id="allcountries">
        <h3>All countries</h3>
        <p>
          Because there is a lot of data available for all the countries, we had to find a way to showcase it entirely without compromising readability. 
          We came up with the following solution - having the user choose between a table, which contains all the data, or two graph types, which is 
          limited to the top 25 countries sorted by total cases. That way, the user can find the information they need, while still getting a visual 
          representation of it. We would've liked to implement a way to pick the countries for direct comparison, but we had to find a faster solution due to the time limit.
        </p>
        <section id="allcountriestable">
          <h5>Table</h5>
          <p>
            Because this is a fast and clean way to showcase all the data, we decided to add it as the first thing a user sees when landing on the front page. 
            Tables help making the data available to the user without visually cluttering the screen. We also wanted to make sure that all the data is 
            available to the user on one of the pages.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="allcountriespb">
          <h5>Pie & Bar</h5>
          <p>
            To avoid visually overloading the user, we decided to add a slider in order to select the number of countries for direct comparison. The slider 
            goes from 5 to 25. The pie chart showcases the total cases of each country as an entire slice, while the bar chart breaks it down as a sum of 
            active cases, deaths and recovered people.
          </p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section id="individualcountries">
        <h3>Individual countries</h3>
        <p>We wanted to give the user the possibility of tracking the statistics for only one country, so all the countries are included in a drop down menu, 
          and each of them has two ways to visualize the data - a pie chart and a bar chart. The pie chart breaks down the past cases as the sum of all the 
          recovered people and the number of deaths, in order to keep track of the country's survivability rate compared to the infection rate.
          The bar chart helps the user see the total cases and recovered people compared to the country's population.
        </p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="involvement">
      <h2>Involvement</h2>
      <p>
        We were both responsible for brainstorming the ways to showcase the data, which was done during an online call. We believe the contribution to brainstorming is split evenly. 
        Adana was responsible for creating the web crawler, the table for all the countries and both bar charts.
        Razvan was responsible for importing and processing the CSV, adding the drop downs, and creating the pie charts.
