# Covid Data Visualization

This was made as part of a 24 hour hackathon during our Human Computer Interaction class. 
We were tasked with creating 5 different explanatory visualizations of data about COVID-19.

## Features
- a crawler that collects the data from [worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and exports it as a CSV file
- 5 ways to visualize the data - a table, two pie charts and two bar charts. You can select to view the data of the top 5 to 25 countries sorted by number of cases, or for each individual country.
- a graphic interface made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
